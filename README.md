# Creational Design Patterns
## Singleton
In two versions one with a unique_ptr as a static class field PointerSingleton 
and the other with static local instance variable, the MeyersSingleton.

Since C++11 local static variables are initialized in a thread safe way, 
making the MeyersSingleton the best option for people desperate enough to use anti patterns.

## Builder
Pizza is an object to be built

PizzaBuilder is an object builder, with many builder derivatives

and PizzaCook is a builder director

## Prototype
In C++ prototype design pattern is partialy present in the form of copy constructor and copy assignment operator

copy constructor is generated by default if the class doesn't define: copy constructor, move constructor, move assignment operator, or destructor

copy assignment operator is generated by default if the class doesn't define: copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, or destructor

The object created by the default copy constructor and the default copy assignment operator is a shalow copy. In order to work with deep copy, the developer needs to define his own copy semantics

In order to use copy constructor or copy assignment oerators, the code needs to know type of object being copied.

This dependency can be removed by introducing Prototype class with virtual clone method, where each deriving class overrides it and provides a copy of itself as a result.
